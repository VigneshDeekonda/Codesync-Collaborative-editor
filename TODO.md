# TODO: Enable Code Execution in Editor Page

- [x] Fix Editorpage.js: Add setOutput to useState for output, attach onClick handler to Run Code button to send POST request to /run endpoint and update output.
- [x] Test code execution for each language (C, C++, Python, JavaScript). Note: Java requires JDK installation to run. C and C++ tested and working.
